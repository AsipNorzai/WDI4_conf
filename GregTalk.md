##How to code a "Jumpy Piranha" game in 10 minutes

Greg is a newbie himself, and he will demo how to code a game like Flappy Bird, the game that earned the creator around $50,000 per day. The demo will be a few minutes, but enough to get you rolling like a cannon ball.

Requirements:

A laptop, wifi.
A webserver installed on the laptop. Rails will do, might be an overkill though.
A few grey cells, fingers and 2 sockets with eyeballs in 'em.
